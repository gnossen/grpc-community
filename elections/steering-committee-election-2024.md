## Introduction

This document captures the procedures for the election of the steering committee
serving 2024/12/16 through 2025/12/15. This election will decide the first project
Steering Committee. As such, there is no current Steering Committee to appoint
the Election Officers. Richard Belleville
([@gnossen](https://github.com/gnossen)) will serve as Election Officer with his
authority stemming from the vote ratifying the governance change present in the
same PR as the initial commit of this document.
